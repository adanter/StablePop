# Project Notes

## Features to Implement

* Add a "kill cap" to predators to represent a predator eating its complete fill during a generation
* Allow the predator population to undergo "genetic bloat", insulating it against mutation
* Remodel prey population growth using a growth curve, so that growth slows as population size approaches the growth cap
* Kill any predators that did not kill any prey before reproduction (or kill mating pairs with no kills between them)
* Add a second parameter to the fitness evaluation that might select for something other than a higher kill rate?
  * Maybe maximum number of kids could change by predator
  * If "kill cap" is implemented, it would be interesting to see what selective pressure does to that
  * Risky, but... what about predator longevity?

## Development Quotes

"We forgot to implement predator death!"
"We cannot contain the predators."
"That doesn't look like it grew the proper amount of kids."
"We're not killing people, we're killing evolving super-predators."
"We're asshole gods."
"Lets see if that... no, they still kill everything."
"Okay, that predator killed 6,375 prey on its own."  "No, I'm fine with that - it led a busy life."
"'The Devolution Bug' sounds like one of those thriller books that James Patterson pops out, like, once a day seemingly."
"They want to have over 100 children and maybe get on a sitcom or something."

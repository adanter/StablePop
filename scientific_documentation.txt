"We forgot to implement predator death!"
"We cannot contain the predators."
"That doesn't look like it grew the proper amount of kids."
"We're not killing people, we're killing evolving super-predators."
"We're asshole gods."
"Lets see if that... no, they still kill everything."
"Okay, that predator killed 6,375 prey on its own."  "No, I'm fine with that - it led a busy life."
"'The Devolution Bug' sounds like one of those thriller books that James Patterson pops out, like, once a day seemingly."
"They want to have over 100 children and maybe get on a sitcom or something."

Variables:
	Predator Reproduction Cap: if this doesnâ€™t exist, then if prey is overly plentiful a single predator can create a number of kids proportional to the prey population - kids that will then go on to wipe out all the prey in the next generation.

Tests to Run:
- Document the base case, with all of the Lotke-Volterra assumptions, both with a single locale and with a 9-locale grid.

Coding to Do:
- Get everything to use the same random seed

Reach Goals:
- Add new migration methods - e.g. number-of-preds-proportional
- Add a prey migration method, allowing repopulation of devastated areas
- Allow predator population to undergo genetic bloat, insulating against mutation
- Remodel prey population growth using a growth curve, so that growth slows as it approaches the growth cap
- Add a "kill cap" to predators, which limits the amount of prey they can kill if presented with an infinite prey population
- Add a second parameter to the fitness evaluation that might select for something other than a higher kill rate?

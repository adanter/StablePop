# Evolving Predators for Population Stability
Adam Klein and Adante Ratzlaff

This code was created to test the effects of predator evolution on predator-prey population dynamics when combined with factors such as migration.  To run a test, set the desired parameters in the clearly-labeled area at the top of Main.java, then compile and run Main.java.
